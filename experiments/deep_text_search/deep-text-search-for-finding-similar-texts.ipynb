A figure above 50 signals expansion, while anything below indicates contraction.\"Growth momentum is still insufficient,\" NBS said in a statement. - Investors eye US factory data -On forex markets the dollar extended gains ahead of the release of American factory data due later on Friday and following a steady stream of good news from the world´s biggest economy.The dollar bought 120.44 yen, compared to 119.44 yen in final 2014 trading on Wednesday.Wall Street toasted a banner year in 2014, with US equity markets finishing near all-time highs.The euro meanwhile slipped amid growing expectations that the European Central Bank, which meets on January 22, will start buying sovereign bonds. The single currency bought $1.2061 compared to $1.2160 in pre-holiday trade.The ECB has already used several tools to push inflation in member nations back up to the 2.0 percent annual rate it regards as healthy, including asset purchases and making cheap loans available to banks.It is also examining the possibility of large-scale purchases of sovereign debt -- so-called quantitative easing (QE) -- to help jump-start the European Union´s moribund economy.Oil prices rose on Friday, with US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February delivery rising 44 cents to $54.07 and Brent crude for February gaining 18 cents to $57.51.\"The gains in Asian trading are likely because of the positive US crude stockpiles data released on Wednesday,\" Daniel Ang, investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore, told AFP.US crude reserves fell by 1.8 million barrels in the week to December 26, the US Energy Information Administration said in its last petroleum report for 2014 released on Wednesday, boosting prices that lost nearly half their value in the second half of the year.There is growing speculation that the slide in global oil prices -- the biggest since the financial crisis in 2008 -- may have been excessive.\"If we do see some supply-side responses, or even if they´re anticipated over the course of this first quarter of the year, we might find that oil has in fact bottomed,\" Michael McCarthy, a chief strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, told Bloomberg.Gold was at $1,182.36 an ounce, compared with $1,199.00 in end-of-year trading on Wednesday.In other markets:-- Jakarta ended up 0.30 percent, or 15.82 points, at 5,242.77.Coal firm Indo Tambangraya Megah gained 3.41 percent to 15,900 rupiah, while miner Aneka Tambang slipped 1.88 percent to 1,045 rupiah.-- Malaysia´s main stock index shed 0.48 percent, or 8.48 points, to close at 1,752.77.Malayan Banking lost 0.55 percent to 9.12 ringgit, Public Bank slipped 0.44 percent to 18.22 while Top Globe added 1.77 percent 4.60 ringgit.-- Singapore rose 0.16 percent, or 5.44 points, to 3,370.59.Agribusiness company Wilmar International gained 0.93 percent to Sg$3.27 while real estate developer Capitaland dipped 0.30 percent to Sg$3.30.-- Mumbai gained 1.38 percent, or 380.36 points, to end at 27,887.90.Housing Development Finance Corp rose 4.30 percent to 1,171.80 rupees, while Mahindra & Mahindra fell 0.92 percent to 1,224.80 rupees.

On Tuesday morning the single currency recovered slightly buying $1.1943.The euro was meanwhile at 142.58 yen against 142.74 yen in US trade and well down from the 144.58 yen Friday.Adding to downward pressure is increased speculation that the European Central Bank will buy eurozone government bonds to counter deflation risks.The dollar was at 119.40 yen early Tuesday, compared with 119.61 in New York Monday and also well down from 120.46 yen Friday.Oil prices were marginally up Tuesday after slipping below $50 for the first time in more than five years in New York.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February delivery rose eight cents to $50.12 while Brent crude for February gained 14 cents to $53.25. WTI tapped $49.95 Monday.The cost of crude has plunged since June as supplies outstrip demand with key consumer China slowing down, the eurozone struggling and the dollar, in which it is priced, strengthening.A decision late last year by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to maintain output despite the glut has also cut into prices.\"The fundamentals of oil are unlikely to change in the first half of this year, which will see oil bedding down into its bear market for months to come,\" IG´s Lucas said.Gold was at $1,203.59.40 an ounce, compared with $1,196.40 on Monday. (AFP)                        \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n',\n"," 'US oil prices Monday slipped below $50 a barrel for the first time in more than five years as the surging dollar and news of additional supplies extended a six-month rout.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February delivery, in free fall since June, ended at $50.04 a barrel, down $2.65 or five percent. The contract got as low as $49.95 a barrel earlier in the session, its lowest level since May 1, 2009.European benchmark Brent oil for February delivery fell $3.31 to $53.11 a barrel in London.Monday´s slide in oil prices followed indications of rising output from key producers Russia and Iraq at a time when forecasters have trimmed their demand projections due to weak global economic growth.The breaching of the psychologically important $50 level also came on a turbulent day for global financial markets. US stocks fell nearly two percent, approaching the drops in European equity markets as the euro plunged to a nine-year low on revived eurozone worries.A long rally in the greenback, which gained 11 percent last year against a basket of major currencies, has weighed on the dollar-priced oil market by making crude more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies.Oil prices could fall further still, analysts say.\"There´s serious concern the bottom´s not in yet,\" said Kyle Cooper, managing partner at IAF Advisors in Houston. \"Basically everyone who´s taken a stab at the bottom has been wrong.\"\"Oil prices attempted to stabilize during the last two weeks, but the fundamentals remain weak,\" said Gene McGillian, broker and analyst at Tradition Energy. \"The market is trying to come to a bottom. It could be anybody´s guess, but it appears we still have more to go.\"Fawad Razaqzada, a technical analyst at Forex.com., said the drop below $50 a barrel could trigger more selling, paving the way for oil to fall as low as $45 or $40 a barrel in the coming weeks.-Weak fundamentals-The retreat in prices comes on the heels of a multi-year boom in US oil production that has shaken the global petroleum market and put the US in a league with oil giants Russia and Saudi Arabia.Other leading producers are also pumping aggressively. Iraq´s oil ministry last week released figures showing that December crude exports reached their highest since 1980.Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has consistently ruled out action despite the months-long slide in prices.In November, the cartel met in Vienna and took no action, as key powerbrokers like Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali al-Naimi said he preferred for the market to balance itself. In December, Naimi told a Middle East publication the group would take the same hands-off approach even if oil fell to $20 a barrel.Meanwhile, economic growth remains uncertain in Europe and in many emerging economies, such as China and Brazil. The International Energy Agency in December projected global crude inventories could rise by nearly 300 million barrels in the first six months of 2015. The agency also cut its demand outlook by more than 200,000 barrels a day for 2015.Energy equities, by far the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 last year, suffered more pain Monday. Dow member Chevron fell 4.0 percent, while oil-services giant Schlumberger lost 2.6 percent.Key US oil companies like ConocoPhillips and shale producer Continental Resources have cut their drilling budgets for 2015.Still, analysts expect US output to continue to rise this year, owing to investments that have already been made. That will put more pressure on crude prices.\"I still think one of the primary drivers of the market is US oil production and I really don´t see US oil production growth slowing appreciably in the first quarter,\" Cooper said.

It is also very good for Pakistan cricket that he is back he said.Talking about the attitude of some Pakistani players that has come into question after comments from some coaches Lawson said if people are not willing to work hard then there are enough good young players in Pakistan to replace them.Get people in who are motivated. If you aren\\x92t playing for your country then there is no point in playing cricket.Pakistan has had some pretty successful times lately under Waqar Younis and Misbah ul Haq and one would hope that the players would continue to be motivated, he said.Commenting on the Day Night Test cricket he said he is surprised at the resistance of some countries.Well done to Pakistan in agreeing to play a Day Night Test match in Australia.The pink ball is not that different to a red ball in any case you just have to practice with it and its fine.We use red or white so why not use pink cricket balls
